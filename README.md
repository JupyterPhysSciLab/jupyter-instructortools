### Introduction
This adds a menu to the Jupyter toolbar that automates some useful tasks an
instructor might want to do while building a notebook template for an 
assignment. This is part of the
[Jupyter Physical Science Lab project](https://github.com/JupyterPhysSciLab).

#### Current Menu Items:
* Menu activated by the python command `import InstructorTools`.
* Menu items to protect/unprotect selected cells. Protected cells cannot be 
  edited or deleted by the user. This is a good way to prevent instructions
  and example code from being damaged by students.
* Menu item for creating a data input table.
    * Table column and row labels can be locked once set.
    * Number of rows and columns must be chosen on initial creation.
    * Table will survive deletion of all cell output data.
    * Default setting is to make the code cell that creates the table
      protected.
    * Table creation code will work without this package installed in the
      Jupyter kernel. Tables are viewable, but not editable in a plain vanilla
      Jupyter install.
    * This uses the `jupyter-datainputtable` package.
* Menu item to delete instructor tools from a notebook before making the
  worksheet available.
* Menu item to delete instructor tools and prevent reinstallation in the
  notebook.
* Menu item to insert code to automatically timestamp the notebook and 
  collect names from students. The cell this is inserted into becomes protected
  against editing and deletion. This is a good cell to include initialization
  imports in.
* Menu item to insert, immediately below the current cell, a markdown cell 
  with boilerplate instructions on initializing a notebook. Insert this 
  immediately above the initialization and timestamping cell. Then edit to 
  meet your needs.
  
#### Typical workflow
Work in a virtual environment that includes this tool plus all the tools
the students will have access to. See [Installation](#installation) for
information on setting up a virtual environment.

1. Start the jupyter notebook server (from the command line `jupyter 
   notebook`).
1. Open a new notebook and type `import InstructorTools` into the first 
   cell. Run the cell.
1. Build the exercise including instructions, examples, tables (use the menu) 
   and imports.
1. Collect all the necessary imports into a code cell that will be the 
   first code cell in the worksheet. You may want introductory material 
   before this cell.
1. Use the menu to add to this initialization cell the command to get the 
   student names and timestamp the notebook. This will simultaneously 
   protect the cell.
1. Use the menu to protect any cells you do not want students to 
   accidentally alter.
1. Restart the kernel and clear all cell outputs. Delete or emtpy any cells 
   that have things you want the students to be filling in.
1. Save the notebook and make a duplicate of it. Continue working with the 
   duplicate.
1. Work through the notebook as if you were a student, make adjustments as 
   you go. Iterate restarting the kernel, clearing the cell outputs, saving,
   duplicating and working though until satisfied.
1. Save the final version of the worksheet. Duplicate it.
1. Open the duplicate worksheet. Make sure all the cell data is cleared. 
   Then select `!deactivate permanently!` from the Instructor Tools menu. 
   This will deactivate the menu and block students from easily 
   reinstalling it. Save the notebook and distribute this copy to students.
   
### Installation
#### _Production_
__Option 1__: for use on your own computer or personal account.

Installation using pip into a virtual environment is recommended.
1. If not installed, install pipenv:`$ pip3 install --user pipenv`. You may
need to add `~/.local/bin` to your `PATH` to make `pipenv`
available in your command shell. More discussion: 
[The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/).
1. Navigate to the directory where this package will be installed.
1. Start a shell in the environment `$ pipenv shell`.
1. Install using pip.
    1. `$ pip install jupyter-instructortools`. This will install Jupyter into the same virtual
    environment if you do not already have it on your machine. If Jupyter is already
    installed the virtual environment will use the existing installation. This takes
    a long time on a Raspberry Pi. It will not run on a 3B+ without at least 1 GB of
    swap. See: [Build Jupyter on a Pi](https://www.uwosh.edu/facstaff/gutow/computer-and-programming-how-tos/installing-jupyter-on-raspberrian).
    1. Still within the environment shell test this by starting jupyter
`$ jupyter notebook`. Jupyter should launch in your browser.
        1. Open a new notebook using the default (Python 3) kernel.
        1. In the first cell import the InstructorTools module:
            `import InstructorTools`
        1. The `InstructorTools` menu should be added to the Jupyter menu bar.
1. _Optional_ You can make this environment available to an alternate Jupyter install as a special kernel when you are the user.
    1. Make sure you are running in your virtual environment `$ pipenv shell` in the directory for  virtual
    environment will do that.
    1. Issue the command to add this as a kernel to your personal space: 
    `$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name=<name-you-want-for-kernel>`.
    1. More information is available in the Jupyter/Ipython documentation. A simple tutorial from Nikolai Jankiev
    (_Parametric Thoughts_) can be found [here](https://janakiev.com/til/jupyter-virtual-envs/). 
 
 __Option 2__: for use in only one account on a Jupyterhub (Instructor only).
 
 Installation as a folder in the account home directory is recommended.
 
 1. Download the latest version .tar.gz [from PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-instructortools/#files) 
 or a .gz [from github](https://github.com/JupyterPhysSciLab/jupyter-instructortools).
 1. Transfer this compressed file to the home directory of the account it will 
 be used in.
 1. Open a terminal and decompress the archive.
 1. Move the folder from the decompressed archive titled "InstructorTools" to
 the home directory of the account. The tools should now be available for
 import into any notebook run in this account.
 
#### _Development_
Simply replace `$ pip install jupyter-instructortools` with
`$ pip install -e ../jupyter-instructortools` in the _Production_ instructions.
